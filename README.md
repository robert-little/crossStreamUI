## What is CrossStream?

CrossStream is a web service that allows for the conversion of music streaming links from one service to many others. The main goal of CrossStream is to solve the problem of a person sharing a music link on a service you may not have access to. If the person instead shares a CrossStream link then everyone will have access to the song! 

## Currently supported services:

Google Play
Spotify
YouTube (converting to YouTube only)

## Using CrossStream

Copy a song link from your perfered, supported, music streaming and paste it into the search bar.
Hit the `Cross the Streams` button 
Now you can copy the URL and share this link with who ever you wish so that everyone will be able to access the link!
